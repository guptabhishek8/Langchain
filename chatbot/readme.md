# Project Overview
This project is a simple chatbot application built with LangChain and Streamlit. It uses a Llama2 model running via Ollama to provide real-time responses to user queries. The application leverages LangSmith for tracing and monitoring the LangChain runs.

# Features
Interactive UI: A simple web interface created with Streamlit allows users to input questions.

Local LLM Integration: Uses a local Llama2 large language model through the Ollama framework.

LangChain Integration: The core logic is built using LangChain's Expression Language (LCEL) to create a chain for processing prompts and generating responses.

LangSmith Tracing: Integrated with LangSmith for detailed tracking and debugging of LLM calls.
